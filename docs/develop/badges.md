## How To Create Badges

We use [Shields.io](https://shields.io/) to generate Badges.
Please use the [badge links section](#_badge_links) to document and update currently used badges.
Open the links and download the svg files and place them in the projects `assets/images` folder or use `curl` instead.

## Download Badges

Simply use `curl` to download badges by providing the `url` and `filename`, that starts with `badge`.

```bash
curl "link" -s -o badge-filename
```

## Badge Links

```bash

```
